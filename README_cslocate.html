<h2 id="what-is-this-">What is this?</h2>
<p><code>cslocate</code> is a simple command-line utility for Linux and similar platforms, that attempts to find the location (country or region) corresponding to an amateur radio callsign. It can either print the best match -- as it understands it -- or all potential matches.  </p>
<p>Of course, there are many potential ways to look up a callsign in online databases. This program is specifically written to work without Internet access -- for portable radio operation, for eample.</p>
<p>The program is written in ANSI-standard C, and should build easily on any Linux-like system with gcc or a similar C compiler.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To find the location of callsign, run <code>cslocate</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ cslocate m6KXB 
M6KXB: England, Foundation License
</code></pre><p>Note that callsigns are not case-sensitive, although they are usually written with upper-case letters.</p>
<p>To list all potential matching locations, use the <code>-a</code> (or <code>--all</code>) switch:</p>
<pre><code>$ cslocate --all EA5XX 
EA5XX: (3) Spain, Valencia (HF)
EA5XX: (3) Spain, Valencia (Full License)
EA5XX: (2) Spain
</code></pre><p>The number in brackets is the number of characters in the supplied callsign that matched the callsign template for the location. Generally, a larger number indicates a better match.</p>
<p>To print the minimum amount of information -- just the country and nothing<br>else:</p>
<p>  $ cslocate -q M6KXB<br>  England</p>
<h2 id="building-the-program">Building the program</h2>
<p>Get the C source code from <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/cslocate">https://github.com/kevinboone/cslocate</a>.</p>
<p>If your system has <code>curl</code> and <code>perl</code>, do </p>
<pre><code>$ ./scripts/get_data.sh
</code></pre><p>To download and parse the latest data files. If not, you can use the versions supplied with the program, although they may be out of date.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<pre><code>$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre><h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Many callsigns are genuinely ambgiguous, partly because national boundaries have a certain fluidity. Accuracy cannot be guaranteed. </p>
<p>The program does not even attempt to determine whether a callsign has ever been issued, or even if it is valid -- it just matches the characters against a set of templates.</p>
<p>Sometimes the <code>--all</code> switch will cause the same data to be displayed more than once, if multiple templates match.</p>
<p>The <code>-q</code> switch will attempt to parse the country name out of the supplied licence description. However, this will not always succeed -- the data the program uses specifically describes regions, and parsing out just the country is not a well-defined process.</p>
