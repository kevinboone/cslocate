<h1>cslocate</h1>

v0.0.1 

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<code>cslocate</code> is a simple command-line utility for Linux and
similar platforms, that attempts to find the location (country or
region) corresponding to an amateur radio callsign. It can either
print the best match -- as it understands it -- or all potential 
matches.
<p/>
The program is written in ANSI-standard C, and should build 
easily on any Linux-like system with gcc or a similar C compiler.
